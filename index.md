## About This Guide

This resource provides physician data scientists with practical, production-ready implementations for developing AI systems in healthcare. The guide covers clinical informatics foundations, machine learning applications, trustworthy AI principles, and real-world deployment strategies.

### What Makes This Different

- **Production-Ready Code**: Complete implementations, not pseudocode
- **Clinical Validation**: Frameworks for regulatory compliance and safety
- **Expert Perspective**: Written by practicing physician data scientists
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From foundations to advanced deployment
- **Regular Updates**: Automated monitoring of latest research

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Basic knowledge of machine learning
- Understanding of healthcare data and clinical workflows
- Familiarity with regulatory requirements (HIPAA, FDA)

### Quick Start

1. **Explore the chapters** using the navigation menu
2. **Download code examples** from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sanjaybasu-waymark/healthcare-ai-book)
3. **Follow deployment guides** for real-world implementation
