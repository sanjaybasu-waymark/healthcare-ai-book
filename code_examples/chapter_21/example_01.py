\# Example 1: Basic Image Segmentation with a Pre-trained U-Net Model (Conceptual)
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as T
from PIL import Image

\# Note: This is a conceptual example. A real implementation would require a full U-Net model definition and trained weights.
\# For a production system, error handling for model loading, image processing, and prediction would be essential.

    Conceptual function to perform image segmentation using a pre-trained U-Net model.
    Error handling (e.g., file not found, invalid image format) is crucial in a production environment.
    '''

                               in_channels=3, out_channels=1, init_features=32, pretrained=True)
        model.eval()

        input_image = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")

            T.Resize((256, 256)),
            T.ToTensor(),

        ])
        input_tensor = transform(input_image).unsqueeze(0)

        with torch.no_grad():
            output = model(input_tensor)

\# Example Usage (conceptual):
\# segmented_mask = segment_image('path/to/surgical_image.png')
\# if segmented_mask is not None:
\#     \# Process the segmentation mask
\#     pass
