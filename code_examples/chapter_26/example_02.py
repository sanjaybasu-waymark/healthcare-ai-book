\# Code Example: Grad-CAM for Medical Image Classification
\# A simplified Python example demonstrating Grad-CAM for a medical image classification model.
\# This code would typically involve:
\# 1. Loading a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet, VGG) fine-tuned on a medical imaging dataset.
\# 2. Preprocessing a medical image (e.g., chest X-ray, histopathology slide) to the model's required input format.
\# 3. Initializing a Grad-CAM object with the model and target convolutional layer.
\# 4. Computing the class activation map (CAM) for a specific target class (e.g., 'pneumonia').
\# 5. Visualizing the heatmap overlaid on the original image to highlight the regions of interest that the model used for its prediction.
