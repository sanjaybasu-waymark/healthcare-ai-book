\# Code Example: Simplified Digital Twin for Glucose Monitoring
\# A conceptual Python example illustrating the core components of a digital twin for glucose monitoring.
\# This code would typically involve:
\# 1. A `PatientDataIntegrator` class to handle data from various sources (EHRs, wearables).
\# 2. A `GlucoseSimulationModel` class that uses physiological equations to predict glucose levels based on inputs like diet and exercise.
\# 3. A `DigitalTwin` class that orchestrates the data flow, runs simulations, and uses a feedback loop (e.g., a Kalman filter) to update the model's state based on real-time data.
\# 4. Comprehensive error handling to manage data inconsistencies, model failures, and communication issues.
