\# Code Example: SHAP for Clinical Prediction Model
\# A simplified Python example demonstrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for a clinical prediction model.
\# This code would typically involve:
\# 1. Loading a clinical dataset (e.g., patient demographics, lab results).
\# 2. Training a machine learning model (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) to predict a clinical outcome (e.g., disease risk).
\# 3. Initializing a SHAP explainer (e.g., `shap.TreeExplainer` for tree-based models).
\# 4. Calculating SHAP values for individual predictions (local interpretability) or for the entire dataset (global interpretability).
\# 5. Visualizing SHAP explanations using plots like `shap.waterfall_plot` for single predictions and `shap.summary_plot` for overall feature importance.
